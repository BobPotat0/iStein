## 🛠️ How It Works

1. iStein runs as a content script on `discord.com`
2. It monitors new messages appearing in chat
3. When a message contains non-target-language text, it sends it to Google Translate's API
4. The translated text is injected below the original message in a subtle, non-intrusive style
